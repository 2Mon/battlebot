# Untitled Document Battlebot

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d3bc796-c390-4a45-80ee-2f9c7c9f9917)

This is my vertical spinner battlebot that I'm calling "Untitled Document". It uses a steel blade that should easily destroy enemy shields and weapons. It uses two steel forks at the front to lift other bots into the spinner, allowing for shots under the bots. 

I have always been interested in battlebots, and being able to build this bot would give me a great chance to participate in a competition with lower stakes than the FTC competitions I normally compete in. A main part of being on an FTC team is the team aspect. While this is a great chance to meet amazing people, it also means that the amount of pressure on you (especially if you are driving the bot) to do well in competitions. I think that combat robotics would be a nice break from the stress of this, as the only pressure you have is from yourself. I would love to be able to compete in competitions like GSCRL, as many of my friends compete, and I would love to be able to connect with more people in the robotics community. Some of my friends in this hobby include @tortlegod, @ruiqimao, and @pearlgray, and they have been amazing influences while designing this bot. I have never met these friends in real life, and being able to meet them through combat robotics would be amazing.

In terms of making and manufacturing this bot, the main frame is going to be printed out of 4 wall 20% gyroid infill 95a TPU, with a steel top plate, forks, and weapon. I have a lot of experience with 3d printing, as I have been in the community for over half my life. Through my FTC competitions, I have also gained a lot of knowledge in the build/design process, and was a major contributor to our robot this year. FTC has taught me important skills, like how to work with aluminum and other metals, and how to use 3d printing DFM to its advantage. For the electronics, I have experience with soldering through custom keyboards and FTC electronics, and I hope to be able to keep my wiring neat and compact. Since this is a 1lb combat robot, it will be difficult to fit all of the needed parts into the weight limit. This is something that I have experienced in FTC, as it is very important to keep your robot lightweight so it can quickly maneuver around the field. I spent a lot of time this season pocketing our aluminum plates to reduce weight, while keeping rigidity in mind. I simulated the robot through impacts using Altair SimSolid to see what an impact would do to the robot. I am very excited to be able to build this robot, as it is a combination of all the things I enjoy doing: 3d printing, building, electronics, and driving robots. Thank you for reading!
