Session 1: 3 hours 

In this session, I found some basic parts I can use for the bot, mainly the drive and hub motors. I started designing a basic frame to mount all the parts to. Pictured here is my innitial motor mount concept.

Session 2: 4 hours

In this session, I continued building out the frame for the bot, prioritizing having well protected wheels and began making a space for the weapon motor to be placed. I will be designing one half of the frame at a time and mirroring it so its easiest. This is my first attempt at a protected wheel.

I also decided to change the front so its more of a wedge shape, hopefully this will help with getting under other bots. I also rounded off some of the sharp corners on the sides to hopefully make the bot more impact resistant. I increased the protection around the wheel here and reflected the body so its one piece.

Session 3: 4 Hours

In this session I designed the hub motor mount and blade. I spent a lot of time looking at other robot's designs for blades, and with @tortlegod's help eventually landed on the design you see here. It has one tooth, as I want to make sure the motor can spin up enough before being ready for a hit. I am using a 2400kV motor from Repeat Robotics. I had to raise up the motor mounting position because the tooth on the blade was longer than I expected it to be. I plan to get the blade cut out of steel, or even titanium if it fits within the budget. I also changed the back of the frame to be more curved, which should help with getting thrown around.
