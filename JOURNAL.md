# Found basic parts to use!

In this session, I found some basic parts I can use for the bot, mainly the drive and hub motors. I started designing a basic frame to mount all the parts to. Pictured here is my innitial motor mount concept.

# Started designing the frame

In this session, I continued building out the frame for the bot, prioritizing having well protected wheels and began making a space for the weapon motor to be placed. I will be designing one half of the frame at a time and mirroring it so its easiest. This is my first attempt at a protected wheel.

I also decided to change the front so its more of a wedge shape, hopefully this will help with getting under other bots. I also rounded off some of the sharp corners on the sides to hopefully make the bot more impact resistant. I increased the protection around the wheel here and reflected the body so its one piece.

# Designed weapon motor mount and blade

In this session I designed the hub motor mount and blade. I spent a lot of time looking at other robot's designs for blades, and with @tortlegod's help eventually landed on the design you see here. It has one tooth, as I want to make sure the motor can spin up enough before being ready for a hit. I am using a 2400kV motor from Repeat Robotics. I had to raise up the motor mounting position because the tooth on the blade was longer than I expected it to be. I plan to get the blade cut out of steel, or even titanium if it fits within the budget. I also changed the back of the frame to be more curved, which should help with getting thrown around.

^ rounded back

I also worked on a color scheme for this bot. Not sure if I will keep it this way, but it doesnt look bad imo

# Redesign time!

I realized that the positioning of my spinner wasnt great in this configuration. The tip of the weapon barely stuck out of the bot and it would be hard to get hits in on low to the ground robot. I decided to redesign the weapon mount, making it angle slightly forwards instead of back. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb3f5f1-2fab-4aec-ab00-7669ebf8cdf1" width="300"/>

As you can see, its now basically vertical, which should make it easier to get hits in on bots. I also lowered the position of the motor with the goal of getting under low bots easier. I also changed out the motors for smaller ones, as the large motors I was using before were overkill for a bot of this size. 

I also spent time designing forks to help lift the other bots into my spinner. I took insperation from bots like "get shrekt" and "Kreigmesser v2" for these. The forks also double as my front "wheels", basically stopping the bot's weapon from scraping on the ground. I had to remove a good chunk of the center of the bot to fit the weapon in, so these forks should keep it high enough off the ground to not contact.

One thing im worried about is that it seems very front heavy, which could be an issue in fights.
