Day 1, 3 hours 

I Found some basic parts I can use for the bot, mainly the drive and hub motors. I started designing a basic frame to mount all the parts to. Pictured here is my innitial motor mount concept.

Day 2, 4 hours

I Continued building out the frame for the bot, prioritizing having well protected wheels and began making a space for the weapon motor to be placed. I will be designing one half of the frame at a time and mirroring it so its easiest. This is my first attempt at a protected wheel.

I also decided to change the front so its more of a wedge shape, hopefully this will help with getting under other bots. I also rounded off some of the sharp corners on the sides to hopefully make the bot more impact resistant. I increased the protection around the wheel here and reflected the body so its one piece.
